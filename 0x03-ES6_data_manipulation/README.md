# 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation

## Project Overview
This project is focused on manipulating data using ES6 features, specifically working with arrays, sets, maps, and typed arrays. The goal is to get hands-on experience in data manipulation using modern JavaScript techniques such as map, filter, and reduce, as well as working with set and map data structures.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Explain how to use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` on arrays.
- Understand typed arrays and their usage.
- Work with `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap` data structures.
